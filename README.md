# Embla - a chess bot

This repo contains code mixing two things I am deeply facinated by: machine learning (ML) and chess. It is work-in-progress, and the aim is to build a supertiny AlphaZero-like chess bot.

Nevertheless: the objective is not to train a very strong bot. Rather, the point is to train it myself, enabling a learning process to understand more about neural nets, Monte Carlo Tree Search and self-play reinforcement learning.
